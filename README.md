# SteamProxyLanCahe

A little project to make myself easy to redownload way faster from Steam

Caches steam files locally. When redownload from steam, checks the cache first.

Steam download servers can be added in steamservers.json.
Config can be changed in settings.json or UI.
You can filter by steamdepot number, eg. 123456;789123. U can place a * to allow caching of all depots.
